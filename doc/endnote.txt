EndNote Integration
Author: David Poole <David.Poole@fccc.edu>

Fox Chase Cancer Center uses a master EndNote DB as the source for abstracts.

Requirements:

sed - unix command.  This is used to quickly remove the <style> tags in the EndNote export. 

Ruby Libraries:
gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
gem install nokogiri
gem install pauldix-sax-machine


To import an EndNote into LatticeGrid:
(Tested with EndNote X2 for Windows)

1. In EndNote select the references you want.
2. Go to the "File" menu and select "Export..."
3. In the dialog set "Save as type" to "XML".
4. Click "Save"
5. Run the following rake task. Specifying the file you exported:
	rake endnote:import file=~/endnote.xml

Once imported you can run the following to associate investigators, MESH terms, etc. 

rake updateAbstractInvestigators updateInvestigatorInformation buildCoauthors tagAbstractsWithMeshTerms tagInvestigatorsWithMeshTerms updateOrganizationAbstractInformation


Notes:

Fox Chase created a custom field (custom2) for PMCID.  You may need to change or remove depending on your EndNote library.

You may need to provide the full path to sed.
